- **Be Considerate**: Remember that your actions can affect others. Take responsibility for your impact on others and the community. Avoid actions that disrupt the community or harm others.
- **Be Professional**: Act professionally in all interactions. Avoid inappropriate language, harassment, and discriminatory behavior. Strive to create an environment where people feel comfortable and can focus on their work.
- **Respect Privacy**: Do not disclose private information without consent. Respect the privacy of others. Protect confidential information and do not share it without proper authorization.

## Unacceptable Behavior
