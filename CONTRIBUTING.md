# How to Contribute

We welcome community contributions to help improve the **Open Source Force** GitHub repositories! Here's how you can get involved:

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Join Our Discord**: For the best experience and to stay updated on discussions, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zWf5jUY8UN). This is where most collaboration, support, and updates happen. If you're interested in contributing to our GitHub repositories, you can ask a **staff member** for guidance.

2. **Fork the Repository**: Find the relevant repository that you want to contribute to and fork it to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the project where you can work on your contributions.

3. **Create a Branch**: Before making changes, create a new branch in your forked repository. It's best to use a descriptive name for the branch, especially if you're working on a specific task (e.g., `feature-new-command` or `fix-bug-123`).

4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, whether it's adding features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation. Feel free to ask for feedback from the community in the Discord server if you need help.

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Once you're done, submit a pull request to the relavant branch. This allows for easier review and integration.

6. **Collaborate**: Keep an eye on the feedback from other contributors and staff on your PR. You may need to make changes or discuss the implementation with the community.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any problems or find bugs in our GitHub repositories:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before submitting a new issue, take a look at the open issues to see if the problem has already been reported or is being worked on.

2. **Create a New Issue**: If your issue hasn't been reported, create a detailed issue in the appropriate GitHub repository. Describe the problem clearly, with steps to reproduce it if possible.

3. **Label Your Issue**: Use relevant labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature request`, `help wanted`) to help categorize your issue and get it to the right team.

4. **Discuss on Discord**: For quicker responses or discussions, you can always bring up issues in the relevant Discord channel. Sometimes, quick fixes or clarification can happen faster here before submitting a GitHub issue.
